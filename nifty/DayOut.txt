47: fresh start in negotiations
47: all options were on the table
47: directly threatened iran with a preemptive nuclear strike it is hard to read his reply in any other way

47: six nations for the first time came together and have put together this resolution we all agreed on that's a significant development
47: nuclear weapon design and weaponization work

47: a number of deficiencies
47: to implement the proposals in october without deviation and we did
47: for us iran's agreement to transfer kg of iran's low enriched uranium leu out of the country would build confidence and reduce regional tensions by substantially reducing iran's leu stockpile

47: the very fact that the iranians have agreed to sign an agreement has already diminished iran's maneuverability
47: if we impose further sanctions that will only increase the secrecy in iran and increase the military orientation of this program
47: unlikely to change tehran's policies particularly since international solidarity is already breaking down over the prospects of harsher bilateral measures
47: i'm sure that they have done their own planning and have their own counter sanction strategy
47: the only way to resolve the iranian issue is to build trust
47: if this deal is followed up with a broader engagement of the iaea and the international community it can be a positive step to a negotiated settlement
