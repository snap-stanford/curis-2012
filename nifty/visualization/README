***Important***

These files must be in the correct places for visualization to work properly as-is.
(Feel free to change path names instead, if that's more convenient!)
The files committed to Github are those that are being frequently changed and added to.

Here are the basic set-up steps:

1) Create the folders ~/public_html/curis/resources/js and ~/public_html/curis/resources/css
2) To resources/js, add the following:
   i. 'jit.cc.js' and 'quotes.cc.js' (which can be found in this folder on Github).
   ii. 'mootools-core-1.4.5.cc.js' and 'mootools-more-1.4.0.1.cc.js'
       (which can be found at /u/shhuang/public_html/curis/resources/js/)
3) To resources/css, add 'quotes.css' (which can be found at /u/shhuang/public_html/curis/resources/css/)
4) Create a folder under ~/public_html/curis/output/clustering/. Feel free to call it anything.
5) To this new folder, add the HTML page(s) found in this folder on Github.
6) Also add any JSON files to this folder, or a subfolder - depending on how you want to organize the code.

Things that will likely have to be changed:
- the output directory that printclusterjson prints to (you can change this in printclusterjson.cpp)
- the path to the JSON file (outputted by printclusterjson) that quotes.cc.js accesses
- perhaps the paths in the HTML pages that link to the .js and .css files, depending on your directory structure
